Tacking budget on and offline

The user will be able to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online.

AS AN avid traveller I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling
